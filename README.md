### Hey!

I'm learning backend using Flask, Python, SQLite3 and Request. I'm interested on Web Scraping, actually I create my own API with BeautifulSoup4.
To the front my strength is JavaScript ES6+ and React.js/React-Native.

I am studying data base and actually I'm learning a lot. ðŸš€


To guide myself I use https://roadmap.sh/ and https://www.google.com/
